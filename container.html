          <h2>Forest and Types</h2>
        
        <p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.[1] <mark> of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function</mark>
            The Food and Agriculture Organization defines a forest as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ.
             It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.</p>

            <p class=border border-danger  text-dark >Acting as a carbon sink. Therefore, they are necessary to mitigate climate change. According to the Special
              Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to avoid temperature rise by more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels,
                  there will need to be an increase in global forest cover 
                equal to the land area of Canada.</p>

               <p class=border border-danger  text-dark>Some researchers state that forests do not only provide benefits, but can in certain cases also incur costs to humans.[37][38] Forests may impose an economic burden,[39][40] diminish the enjoyment of natural areas,[41] reduce the food producing capacity of grazing land[42] and cultivated land,[43] reduce biodiversity[44][45] reduce available water for humans and wildlife,
                     harbour dangerous or destructive wildlife, and act as reservoirs of human and livestock disease.[49][50</p>

            <h3>Evolutionary history</h3>
            <p class="border border-danger  text-warning " >The first known forests on Earth arose in the Late Devonian (approximately 380 million years ago), with the evolution of Archaeopteris.[24] Archaeopteris was a plant that was both tree-like and fern-like, growing to 10 metres (33 ft) in height. Archaeopteris quickly spread throughout the world, from the equator to subpolar latitudes.[24] Archaeopteris formed the first forest by being the first known species to cast shade due to its fronds and forming soil from its roots. 
                Archaeopteris was deciduous, dropping its fronds onto the forest floor. </p>
